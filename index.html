            <h1 id="title">python is better than java</h1>
            <p id="mainText">python is just objectively better than java, even if java is easier to make a build with you can still do that with python but your code will be like 100 lines shorter and will be done hours earlier and half the time in java your errors arnt even errors they're just oo no ; like omg who cares why doesn't the ide auto put one like if it just highlighted it after wards than the coder will see it and could delete it if it isnt ment to be there or could like change it in settings or something its just so pointless. Then java coders go like oH BUt JaVa cAN Do guI's beTter and like sure but also id rather just learn tkinter than a hole new language and honestly what are you going to do with java like most software is made in C or somthing and websites are javascript so why bother with java atleast python is a good entry to coding java just sucks</p>
